## Design in FreeCAD, simulate with OpenEMS

3D electromagnetic FDTD simulations are a tool to analyze, among other things (like S-parameters and radiation patterns of antenna structures, TDR simulation), circuits with distributed elements and custom air-core magnetics. 

Never heard of OpenEMS? Check out [Thorsten Liebig's FOSDEM talk](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/openems/) for a gentle introduction (27 min video).

The focus of this article is to document a foray into this territory under Windows.
