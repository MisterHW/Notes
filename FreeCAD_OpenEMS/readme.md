## Design in FreeCAD, simulate with OpenEMS

3D electromagnetic FDTD simulations are a tool to analyze, among other things (S-parameters and radiation patterns of antenna structures, TDR simulation), circuits with distributed elements and custom air-core magnetics. 

The focus of thie article is to document a foray into this territory under Windows.
